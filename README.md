Assignment Part 1: Building a RAG system
RAG systems are one of the most widely used patterns which is powering a lot of AI applications. The basic idea is using an external data source in a vector database along with an LLM. You have to build a RAG system which works on a medium sized dataset. In this case you would be working with NCERT PDF text.
Build a RAG system and serve it using a FastAPI endpoint. You should be able to send a query and get a response back.
You can use any frontend you see fit to showcase this endpoint.
